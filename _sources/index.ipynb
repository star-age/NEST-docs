    "**NEST** (**N**eural network **E**stimator of **S**tellar **T**imes) is a python package designed to make the use of pre-trained neural networks for stellar age estimation easy.\n",

    "\n",
    "With it, you can estimate the ages of stars based on their position in the Color-Magnitude Diagram and their metallicity. It contains a suite of Neural Networks trained on different stellar evolutionary grids. If observational uncertainties are provided, it can compute age uncertainties.\n",
